.TH HAWK 1 2021-08-19 GNU/Linux "General Commands Manual"
.SH NAME 
hawk \- watch with environment heuristics 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hawk
[OPTION..] [COMMAND]
.SH DESCRIPTION
hawk runs a command for n seconds (2 seconds by default)
and displays its output, updated every interval.
The shell is determined dynamically from the environment,
which can be overriden by its environment variable or 
a command line switch (
.B -s
).
.SH OPTIONS
.IP ""  1
.I -n, --interval
.I NUMBER
 Set refresh interval in seconds(default is 2 seconds).

.I -s, --shell 
.I PATH
 Set specific shell to be used instead.

.B Note:
If the shell doesn't support non interactive shell calls,
a POSIX compliant shell is expected at command "sh".

.I --force-stdout
 Force Standard Output on display

.B Note:
Normally hawk dynamically determines the output to
be displayed, based on the command's exit status. If
your command always prints to STDOUT regardless of
its exit status use this option.

.I -v, --version
 Print version information and exit successfully.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B $SHELL

.I The shell to be used by default(usually set by your initscripts).

.B $PATH

.I Relied upon for shell resolution(for portability reasons)

.SH RETURN STATUS
Almost always exits successfully, unless you specify invalid options,
numbers, commands. If you play it right, it will exit successfully...
